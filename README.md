# country-codes-on-any-phone-field-type-tel

With this code you'll be able to put country codes on any phone field which has the input type="tel" attribute. It is only for wordpress. Copy codes from functions.php file and then paste it to your themes functions.php file and it will start working.

#Functions.php file
This file includes the country codes but it will not have any default country selected. though the country selection will still work.

#Functions2.php
This file includes the country selection on phone fields with a by default country selected option. Just change the "bd" and place your country shortcode/shortname there. and then it will show your country selected by default.
